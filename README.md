# afry-competence-nlp
New Repo, New Company Name. The old repo (github.com/Lundez/afCompetenceNLP-ML) got out of sync &amp; was badly maintained. Will work to keep this one fresh and better structured.


## 2020:1 SparkNLP
Prerequisites:
Scala 2.11
Spark 2.4.4
SparkML: 2.4.4
SparkNLP: 3.4.6

I think only Spark is required to be installed on system, I used Linux Brew (I [think](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/installing-scala-and-apache-spark-on-mac-os-837ae57d283f/) this should work)
Also same applies to `appache-zeppelin`.

zeppelin-daemon.sh start

Notes from old repo:
Meeting 2: Text Classification - Quora Insincere questions
In this meeting we created a path forward on how to focus & work. We also decided to use SpaCy as a starting tool in this task of Quora. https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s56aBkUrkYLCRblDMGHBeHpRNaEQpAs9
